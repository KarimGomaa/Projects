## Overview

The AUTOSAR Port Driver module provides services for configuring the I/O ports of a microcontroller. It abstracts the hardware-specific details and offers a standardized API for the upper layers of the software stack, ensuring portability and scalability across different microcontroller platforms.

## Features

- **Pin Configuration:** Supports the configuration of pin direction (input/output), mode (analog/digital), and other attributes such as pull-up/pull-down resistors.
- **Port Control:** Provides APIs for setting and reading the state of port pins.
- **Port Mode Switching:** Allows for dynamic switching between different port configurations during runtime.
- **Error Handling:** Implements error detection and reporting mechanisms as per AUTOSAR guidelines.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be scalable and adaptable to various microcontroller architectures.

## Architecture

The AUTOSAR Port Driver module is structured according to the AUTOSAR layered architecture:

- **Port Module:** The core of the Port Driver, responsible for managing port configurations and control.
- **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer):** The hardware abstraction layer that interacts directly with the microcontroller hardware.
- **AUTOSAR API:** The standardized interfaces provided by the Port Driver for upper layers (e.g., Application Layer, RTE).

## Implementation Details

### Port Configuration

The Port Driver allows for the configuration of each port pin based on the following parameters:

- **Pin Direction:** Input or Output.
- **Pin Mode:** Digital or Analog mode.
- **Internal Resistor:** Pull-up, Pull-down, or no resistor.
- **Initial Level:** Default high or low state for output pins.

### Port Control

APIs are provided to perform the following operations:

- **Port_SetPinDirection:** Sets the direction of a specific pin.
- **Port_RefreshPortDirection:** Refreshes the port pin directions based on the configured mode.
- **Port_GetVersionInfo:** Retrieves version information of the Port module.

## Configuration

The Port Driver module is highly configurable through the use of configuration files. The configuration is typically generated by a tool (e.g., ECU configuration tool) and includes:

- **Port Pin Settings:** Direction, mode, initial state, and resistor configuration for each pin.
- **Port Mode Settings:** Configuration for mode switching.
- **Error Handling Configurations:** Settings for enabling or disabling specific error detections.

## Testing and Validation

The implementation of the AUTOSAR Port Driver has been thoroughly tested and validated against the following criteria:

- **Compliance with AUTOSAR Standards:** Verified to meet AUTOSAR specifications.
- **Functional Testing:** Includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure correct behavior.
- **Performance Testing:** Benchmarked for efficiency and resource usage.
- **Error Handling:** Tested for robustness in detecting and handling errors.
